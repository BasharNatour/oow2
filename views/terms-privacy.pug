              h3 <span> 1.</span> WeddingWire is a Neutral Venue:
              p  <span>OowEgypt is a Neutral Venue:</span> OowEgypt is an innovative community and marketplace for the wedding industry. OowEgypt is not a wedding product or service provider, wedding vendor or an agent representative. OowEgypt members ("Members") include prospective brides and grooms, newlyweds and their Wedding guests (collectively, "Wedding Members") and companies and other third parties offering products and services related to Weddings ("Vendor Members"). We and the Site function solely as a neutral venue and digital clearinghouse where Wedding Members and Vendor Members may connect for a particular type of service or product. We are not involved in or a party to the actual transaction between Members. As a result, We have no control over the existence, quality, accuracy, safety, or legality of the transactions that take place on our Website, the accuracy of listings, the ability of Wedding Vendors to provide items or perform services, the ability of Wedding Members to pay for any goods and services, and we make no representations or warranties and are not liable or responsible for the actions or inactions of Members or Vendor Members. OowEgypt does not endorse any particular Vendor Member.
          
              h4 Wedding Members: 
              p You acknowledge the following: OowEgypt does not provide any of the products or services advertised or offered by Vendor Members. We do not endorse any Vendor Member, nor do We guarantee the quality of their goods or services. Any and all communications, correspondence, verbal or written, or any warranties or representations, made with regard to products and services offered through the OowEgypt venue are not provided by us and are specifically and solely between you and the Vendor Member. Any transaction you enter into with a Vendor Member is strictly between you and the Vendor Member, and WeddingWire is not a party to that transaction. Any dispute you have with a Vendor Member is between you and the Vendor Member, and We will not be a party to that dispute, except regarding your use of the Site, as discussed in Section 32.<br>We use techniques to help verify the identity of Wedding Vendors when they register for memberships on our Site; however, OowEgypt cannot and will not guarantee each service provider's identity; capabilities, or that it has obtained all required permits, licenses or consents or that it complies with all applicable laws. We have implemented a user-managed feedback system to help you evaluate Vendor Members with whom you are considering transacting business. In addition, We cannot guarantee that information provided by or about Vendor Members on the Site is accurate. You should use OowEgypt as a starting point for identifying vendors to provide the products and services you need for your wedding, then conduct your own research to ensure that vendors you choose to do business with are appropriate for you. You acknowledge that participation in certain programs, when and if available, may under certain circumstances result in Vendor Members receiving contact information for you in accordance with the terms and conditions governing these programs.</p>
              
              h4 Vendor Members:

While all Wedding Members are required to give us accurate information about themselves, We cannot and will not verify this information or guarantee the ability of Wedding Members to complete payment for any of the products or services you provide. Any transaction you enter into with a Wedding Member is strictly between you and the Wedding Member, and OowEgypt is not a party to that transaction. You are responsible for for obtaining all permits, licenses and consents necessary to deliver your goods or services and complying with all applicable laws. Any dispute you have with a Wedding Member is between you and the Wedding Member, and We will not be a party to that dispute. Vendor Members must list the true and correct name of their business on the Site and if there is a change to that business name, the Vendor Member must promptly update OowEgypt and may need to provide additional documentation for proof of name change. After OowEgypt and the Vendor Member have terminated their relationship, OowEgypt shall be entitled to retain all reviews associated with a Vendor Member on the Site as well as basic directory information, including, without limitation, business name, mailing address, website address and telephone number.

When you submit a review or a counter-review on the OowEgypt Site, we may make your review public on the Site or on other OowEgypt properties or through our partners and affiliates. If you provide a review for a vendor that is not yet part of our catalog, or if you add a new vendor to your planning tools, we will use the information that you provide about the vendor to notify the vendor that a review has been completed and that we are adding the vendor to our catalog. We will also seek that vendor's greater involvement with our Site. Your OowEgypt Profile information will be made available as part of the review posting. 
              
              h3  Publicly Disclosed Information 
              p OowEgypt does not have any obligation of privacy with regard to information that a User discloses publicly on the Site, including, without limitation, publicly posted profile information, forum comments, reviews, or pictures.

If a OowEgypt Vendor is registered, the vendor's Storefront will be made available on the Catalog unless the vendor chooses to unregister from the Site. As specified in our Terms of Use, after WeddingWire and the Vendor User have terminated their relationship, OowEgypt shall be entitled to retain all reviews associated with a Vendor User on the Site as well as basic directory information, including, without limitation, business name, address and telephone number. 
              
              h3 Advertising
